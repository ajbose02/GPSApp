# GPSApp
Implements MapKit to create a route and directions between the user's location and a searchable location. Makes queries to MKLocalSearchCompleter to show options as the user searches for a location, then makes a natural language query to MKLocalSearch to obtain the placemark of the selected location. Makes annotations on the map, and gives the user an option to show directions to any location.
